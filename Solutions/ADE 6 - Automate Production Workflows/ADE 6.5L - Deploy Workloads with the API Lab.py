# MAGIC # Lab: Working with the Databricks API
# MAGIC In this lab, you will use the Databricks CLI to work with DLT pipelines
# MAGIC
# MAGIC By the end of this lab, you should be able to:
# MAGIC * Programmatically deploy a workload using the Databricks CLI

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC Run the setup script for this lab by running the cell below.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %run ./Includes/Classroom-Setup-06.5L

# COMMAND ----------

db_token, db_instance = DA.get_credentials()

# MAGIC ## Run your pipeline using the CLI
# MAGIC The pipeline you will be working with was generated when you ran the classroom setup script at the top of this notebook. The output from that cell shows, among other things, your pipeline's name. Use the pipeline name to get your pipeline id from the list of pipelines [here](#joblist/pipelines)
# MAGIC  
# MAGIC Open the driver's terminal by clicking View -> Open web terminal in the menu at the top of the page, and run the proper CLI command to start your pipeline.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Check your work
# MAGIC To check your work, execute the following Python code. This uses the Pipelines API to check whether you've successfully triggered an update for your pipeline.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Note: if this fails and states that the pipeline's state is "COMPLETED", you may not have run the script quickly enough after starting the pipeline. Try running the pipeline again, and immediately run the Python code.

# COMMAND ----------

# ANSWER
# # You can alternatively use the DA object (provided by the setup script at the beginning of this lesson) to start the pipeline
DA.start_pipeline()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Run Python script
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can also run this check within the Web Terminal by running the `check_pipeline.py` script created for you by the setup script above.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Run the script by entering:
# MAGIC ```python /tmp/python/check_pipeline.py```
