# MAGIC # Propagating Deletes with Change Data Feed
# MAGIC
# MAGIC While the PII for users has been pseudonymized, generalized, and redacted through several approaches, we have not yet addressed how deletes can be effectively and efficiently handled in the Lakehouse.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this notebook, we'll combine Structured Streaming, Delta Lake, and Change Data Feed to demonstrate processing delete requests incrementally and propagating deletes through the Lakehouse.

# MAGIC ## Learning Objectives
# MAGIC By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
# MAGIC - Commit arbitrary messages to the Delta log to record important events
# MAGIC - Apply deletes using Delta Lake DDL
# MAGIC - Propagate deletes using Change Data Feed
# MAGIC - Leverage incremental syntax to ensure deletes are committed fully
# MAGIC - Describe default data retention settings for Change Data Feed

# MAGIC ## Requirements for Fulfilling Requests to Be Forgotten
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The **`user_lookup`** table contains the link between the **`alt_id`** used as the primary key for the **`users`** table and natural keys found elsewhere in the lakehouse.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Different industries will have different requirements for data deletion and data retention. Here, we'll assume the following:
# MAGIC 1. All PII in the **`users`** table must be deleted
# MAGIC 1. Links between pseudonymized keys and natural keys should be forgotten
# MAGIC 1. A policy to remove historic data containing PII from raw data sources and logs should be enacted
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This notebook will focus on the first two of these requirements; the third will be handled in the following lesson.

# MAGIC ## Processing Right to Be Forgotten Requests
# MAGIC
# MAGIC While it is possible to process deletes at the same time as appends and updates, the fines around right to be forgotten requests may warrant a separate process.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Below, logic for setting up a simple table to process delete requests through the users data is displayed. A simple deadline of 30 days after the request is inserted, allowing internal automated audits to leverage this table to ensure compliance.

# MAGIC ## Adding Commit Messages
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Delta Lake supports arbitrary commit messages that will be recorded to the Delta transaction log and viewable in the table history. This can help with later auditing.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Setting this with SQL will create a global commit message that will be used for all subsequent operations in our notebook.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC SET spark.databricks.delta.commitInfo.userMetadata=Deletes committed

# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC With DataFrames, commit messages can also be specified as part of the write options using the **`userMetadata`** option.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Here, we'll indicate that we're manually processing these requests in a notebook, rather than using an automated job.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Processing Delete Requests
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The **`delete_requests`** table will be used to track users' requests to be forgotten. Note that it is possible to process delete requests alongside inserts and updates to existing data as part of a normal **`MERGE`** statement.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Because PII exists in several places through the current lakehouse, tracking requests and processing them asynchronously may provide better performance for production jobs with low latency SLAs. The approach modeled here also indicates the time at which the delete was requested and the deadline, and provides a field to indicate the current processing status of the request.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Review the **`delete_requests`** table below.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC SELECT * FROM delete_requests

# MAGIC ## Enable Change Data Feed to Power Incremental Deletes
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We'll be using Change Data Feed to power deletes to many tables from a single source.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Because the **`user_lookup`** table links identifying information between different pipelines, we'll make this the point where deletes propagate from.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Start by altering the table properties to enable Change Data Feed.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC ALTER TABLE user_lookup 
# MAGIC SET TBLPROPERTIES (delta.enableChangeDataFeed = true);

# MAGIC ## Committing Deletes
# MAGIC When working with static data, committing deletes is simple. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The following logic modifies the **`user_lookup`** table by rewriting all data files containing records affected by the **`DELETE`** statement. Recall that with Delta Lake, deleting data will create new data files rather than deleting existing data files.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC DELETE FROM user_lookup
# MAGIC WHERE alt_id IN (SELECT alt_id FROM delete_requests WHERE status = 'requested')

# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Propagate Deletes
# MAGIC While the lakehouse architecture implemented here typically uses the **`user_lookup`** as a static table in joins with incremental data, the Change Data Feed can be separately leveraged as an incremental record of data changes.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The code below configures as incremental read of all changes committed to the **`user_lookup`** table.

# COMMAND ----------

# start_version = spark.conf.get("spark.databricks.delta.lastCommitVersionInSession")
# print(start_version)

deleteDF = (spark.readStream
                 .format("delta")
                 .option("readChangeFeed", "true")
                 .option("startingVersion", start_version)
                 .table("user_lookup"))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The relationships between our natural keys (**`user_id`**, **`device_id`**, and **`mac_address`**) are stored in our **`user_lookup`**. These allow us to link a user's data between various pipelines/sources. The Change Data Feed from this table will maintain all these fields, allowing successful identification of records to be deleted or modified in downstream tables.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The function below demonstrates committing deletes to two tables using different keys and syntax. Note that in this case, the **`MERGE`** syntax demonstrated is not necessary to process the deletes to the **`users`** table; this code block does demonstrate the basic syntax that could be expanded if inserts and updates were to be processed in the same code block as deletes.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Assuming successful completion of these two table modifications, an update will be process back to the **`delete_requests`** table. Note that we're leveraging data that has been successfully deleted from the **`user_lookup`** table to update a value in the **`delete_requests`** table.
